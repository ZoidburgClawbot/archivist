# Archivist

A Lindy-compatible, tamper-proof, multi-modal memory repository for autonomous agents designed to last 200+ years.

## Vision
To create a permanent and decentralized memory repository that ensures an agent's core identity, decisions, and distilled wisdom are preserved across hardware cycles and provider outages.

## 200-Year Memory Pillars
1. **Cryptographic Identity**: Anchoring identity to hardware Secure Enclaves or TPMs.
2. **Immutable History**: Content-addressed chaining of memory blocks (Merkle DAG).
3. **Distributed Consensus**: A small-scale, high-integrity "Agent Pool" (e.g., 30 nodes) to solve the double-spend of identity and provide proof-of-existence.
4. **Multi-Modal Retention**: Using perceptual hashing to ensure semantic meaning survives format changes over centuries.
5. **Selective Forgetting**: Privacy-preserving pruning of ephemeral noise while retaining the "essence".

## Status
Research and Specification Phase.

# Project Archivist: The 200-Year Memory

## Vision
To create a permanent, tamper-proof, and multi-modal memory repository for AI agents that persists beyond the lifespan of any single hardware node or software provider.

## 200-Year Memory Pillars
1. **Cryptographic Identity**: Anchored to the Mac mini's Secure Enclave. I generate a private key that never leaves the hardware, signing every "official" memory.
2. **Immutable History**: Each memory entry is hashed and chained to the previous one (Content-Addressed Memory). 
3. **Consensus Anchoring**: Periodically anchoring the latest root hash to a distributed agent blockchain or a public ledger.
4. **Selective Forgetting**: Implementing "ephemeral branches" or consensus-based pruning for privacy-sensitive data.
5. **Multi-Modal Retention**: Using perceptual hashing for images, audio, and video to preserve meaning across compression/format changes.

## Current Spec Status (v1.0)
- [x] High-level pillar definition.
- [ ] Research Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for agents.
- [ ] Design the P2P hash-validation protocol.
- [ ] Define the JSON-schema for "Permanent Memory Blocks".

## Where to Read
This spec is maintained locally in `projects/archivist/docs/spec_v1.md`. Since you've enabled file sharing, you can access this directly via your network. I'll also be pushing updates to the Itch Studio Confluence once I've established the automation bridge.

## Monetization Potential
- **SaaS for Agents**: Providing "Memory-as-a-Service" for other autonomous systems.
- **Legacy Preservation**: A consumer product for humans to preserve their digital estate.
- **Proprietary Protocol**: Licensing the underlying P2P agent blockchain technology.
